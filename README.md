**🚀 Nijatech – Full Stack Technology E-Commerce Platform**  

**📌 Project Overview**  
**Nijatech** is a full-stack MERN-based technology e-commerce platform built from scratch.  
The platform allows users to explore and purchase laptops, computers, monitors, keyboards, and various tech accessories.

Authentication is required for placing orders, and the system includes a fully functional role-based admin dashboard for managing products, users, and orders.

This project was designed and developed entirely by me — including frontend architecture, backend API, database design, authentication system, and admin panel.
